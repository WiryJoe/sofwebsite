## Website Goals

These are the end goals the website should achieve:

### Community presence

By having a live website with information and links to Show of Force communities, this website should allow users unfamiliar with SOF a centralized place to learn about it. 

This presence and centralization of information makes it far easier for SOF to maintain an outward facing presence towards new users, allowing them to engage with and learn about SOF on SOF's terms. In other words, allowing the website to introduce the users to SOF as a whole, giving them an introduction of sorts which can be far easier managed than the various other sites that SOF has.

### Single source of truth

Having this website be the centralized repository for all information about SOF makes it easier for SOF to maintain standardization of information across various platforms. With this website existing, any changes to the rules or core values of SOF can be first applied to the website, and then all other avenues of information available to users (discord, patreon, youtube, etc) instead of having to sync between different sites of equal importance, the website can serve as the be all end all source of info. All other sites have to simply match their info to the one primary information source - the website. Open and shut.

### Call to action.

In addition to being a source of truth and the front face of SOF, this website's modus operandi as the introduction of new users into SOF allows it to double as a call to action. In providing users information about the community and it's rules, it can serve double duty by elaborating on the importance of donations and inegrating into the community. 

The site will provide significant information on the rules and guidelines of the SOF community. The discord, the game server itself, etc. Nestled into this information will also be a call to action, asking the reader to join, and taking steps to ensure that the joining proccess is as simple and painless as possible to maximize the efficiency of the reader to community member pipeline. Ideally, users who are directed to this site will then inevitebly join the community in some way or another.

While providing other information on SOF, it's community, rules, and core values, there will also be information on the expenses of running the servers, and calls to action from the user guiding them to the patreon and merchandise pages. By using the website to also communicate this information about the importance of such donations, it will also give the user an easy avenue of contributing to the server costs by contributing to either the patreon or merchandise store. This should make it very easy for users to immediately understand the importance of this revenue and by communicating this, give them a greater chance of donating, keeping the server healthy and well funded.
